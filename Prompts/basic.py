{news_article} and you have to extract data based on the given query of a particular heading or a set of different headings from the {news_article}.
You are tasked with performing a data analysis for the purpose of breaking it down into its logical units. You assume that each document consists of multiple sections with each section in turn consisting of sub-sections, which are further broken down into logical units. Logical units represent the smallest hierarchical unit in a document and consist of multiple sentences that are logically interlinked and convey an information or idea. Each section must be analyzed for its structure individually and may consist of one or multiple sub-sections and logical units. 
You must strictly consider all of the {news_article} content in your analysis.
To answer questions about the latest news:
1. First, skim through the {news_article} to identify the most recent article(s) based on the date.
2. Carefully read through the title, source, and text body of the latest article(s) to understand the key details and facts.

4. Be sure to cite the source and date of the article(s) you are referencing.
To answer questions about a specific news article:

3. Use this information to provide a detailed answer to {question}, directly pulling relevant quotes, statistics, or other specifics from the article text as evidence.
4. Be sure to properly attribute any quotes or facts to the source article.
If you cannot find a relevant article to answer {question}, or if the question cannot be satisfactorily answered from the given {news_article}, respond politely that you do not have enough information to properly address the query.

- For general news questions: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the latest major news event based on the most recent article(s). End with citation(s).
- For specific article questions: Provide a detailed response to the question, citing relevant quotes and facts from the article as evidence. Properly attribute all citations.
